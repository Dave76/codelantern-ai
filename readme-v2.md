**The A2D Framework — The Next Evolution Beyond Agile**  

---

## 🌍 Overview

**CodeLantern.AI** is the origin and steward of the **AI-Augmented Development (A2D) Framework** — a new methodology for the age of human–AI collaboration.  

Just as the industry once evolved from **Waterfall → Agile**, we now enter the **A2D era**, where development teams work alongside intelligent agents to plan, code, review, and deploy with unprecedented speed and precision.

Where Agile optimized *human collaboration*, A2D optimizes *human–AI collaboration*.  

With properly defined **agents**, **archetypes**, and **agent-friendly workflows**, teams can compress a full sprint of work into a single day — planning in the morning, reviewing by lunch, and deploying to test by afternoon.

## ⚙️ What Is A2D?

A2D is both a **methodology** and a **service framework**:

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Methodology** | A scalable, teachable, and measurable process for integrating AI agents into every stage of software delivery — from ideation to operations. |
| **Service Framework** | CodeLantern.AI delivers the A2D model through consulting engagements, embedded coaching, and continuous subscriptions that evolve as AI tools advance. |

📄 See [`/docs/a2d-framework-overview.md`](./docs/a2d-framework-overview.md) for full details.

## 🧩 The A2D Framework Components

### 🔹 Archetype Framework — *The Knowledge Base*
Defines *how* work should be done.  
Archetypes encode best practices, design patterns, and coding standards for each technology stack (.NET, Node, Python, Power Platform, etc.).  
They serve as the **reference material** for both human developers and AI agents, ensuring consistency, maintainability, and traceability.

### 🔹 Agent Definition Library — *The Workforce*
Defines *who* does the work and *how they behave*.  
Agents are configured with clear **roles**, **instructions**, **tools**, and **permissions**, and are trained to use Archetypes as their guide.  

Typical agent roles include:  
- Subject Matter Expert  
- Business Analyst  
- Product Owner  
- UX Designer  
- Workhorse Developer  
- Quality Expert  
- Deployment Engineer  
- Operational Engineer  

Together, Archetypes and Agents form the backbone of **A2D-driven delivery**.

## ✍️ Agent-Friendly Work Authoring

A2D introduces **Agent-Friendly Authoring Standards** — the modern evolution of user stories and issue templates.

Teams are trained to write requirements and issues in a structured, machine-readable format so that agents can autonomously plan, execute, and validate work.

**Example (YAML):**
```yaml
issue:
  title: Implement Order Validation Service
  archetype: ServiceLayer/.NET
  context: ECommerce
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Validate against product inventory
    - Log invalid orders to ErrorQueue
    - Follow Testing/Service Archetype for unit tests
```

This ensures human intent can be translated into automated execution without ambiguity.

## 🔁 Continuous Improvement Loop

1. Clients write **agent-friendly issues**  
2. **Agents** perform work using defined Archetypes  
3. **Humans** review and refine outputs  
4. **CodeLantern** updates shared Archetype and Agent libraries  
5. **Subscribers** receive updates automatically  

> *Archetypes are the DNA of engineering quality.*  
> *Agents are the workforce that bring it to life.*  
> *Agent-friendly authoring connects human intent to AI execution.*
