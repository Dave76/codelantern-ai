## CodeLantern {.title-slide}

Transforming software development through AI-augmented collaboration.

::: {.incremental}
- **Professional services** delivering A2D enablement
- **Proprietary tools & methodology** as our competitive advantage
- **Empower development teams** to achieve 10x velocity with human control
- **Solve business problems** for organizations lacking dev resources
:::

::: {.notes}
**Opening remarks:**
- CodeLantern is pioneering the A2D (AI-Augmented Development) space
- We're not replacing developers - we're amplifying their capabilities through structured human-AI collaboration
- Our business model has two revenue streams: enablement services (teaching teams our methodology) and delivery services (using our methodology to build solutions)
- Key differentiator: we've developed proprietary archetypes (best-practice blueprints) and agents that execute these playbooks
- The "human control" aspect is critical - we maintain guardrails that prevent agents from making unchecked decisions
- Target market includes both tech companies wanting to accelerate development and non-tech companies needing development capabilities
