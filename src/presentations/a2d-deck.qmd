## A2D is not vibe coding

### Vibe Coding — Definition

::: {.incremental}
- Development approach where the human sets the direction and the AI handles the details  
- Emphasis on speed, experimentation, and “vibes” rather than clear structure  
- Heavy reliance on natural-language prompts with minimal scaffolding  
- Great for prototypes and quick experiments, but weaker on governance and repeatability

## A2D on the spectrum

![](../src/images/a2d-mikes-03.png){fig-alt="AI development spectrum with A2D between traditional dev and vibe coding" width="90%"}

::: {.incremental}
- **Traditional Development** – Little or no AI assistance  
- **Vibe Coding** – AI drives most implementation; humans steer loosely  
- **A2D** – Structured collaboration between humans and AI agents, with:
  - Clear roles
  - Guardrails and governance
  - Repeatable workflows
:::

---

## Demo Time

![](../src/images/a2d-mikes-04.png){fig-alt="GitHub Copilot agents screen" width="80%"}

::: {.incremental}
- Show GitHub Copilot **coding agents** in action  
- Walk through how A2D workflows are executed end-to-end  
- Anchor the conversation in something tangible and working
:::

---

## A2D Workflows – Overview

![](../src/images/a2d-mikes-05.png){fig-alt="High-level A2D workflow diagram" width="80%"}

::: {.incremental}
- **GitHub & GitHub Copilot** – Core platform  
- **Model providers** – OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini  
- **A2D Artifacts** – Agent definitions, archetypes, workflows  
- **A2D Subscription** – Controlled access to IP & tooling  
- **A2D Methodology** – Ceremonies and ways of working
:::

---

## Foundation: GitHub & A2D

::: {.incremental}
- GitHub + GitHub Copilot + GitHub Coding Agents form the **execution layer**  
- We rely on:
  - Repos, PRs, issues, projects, labels, releases  
  - Copilot’s **agent orchestration** and tool permissions  
- Today, GitHub Coding Agents primarily use **Claude Sonnet 4.5** underneath
:::

### Issue Templates

::: {.incremental}
- Written by humans **for agents**  
- Standardize:
  - Requirements
  - Sizing
  - Labels & priority
- Make work **machine-readable** and consistent
:::

---

## Agent Definitions

::: {.incremental}
- Describe the **type of work** an agent should complete  
- Configure:
  - Access to MCP servers
  - Tools and permissions
  - Allowed workflows  
- Examples:
  - `[planner]`, `[interviewer]`, `[architect]`
  - `[curator]`, `[workhorse]`, `[tester]`
:::

---

## MCP Registries

::: {.incremental}
- **GitHub MCP Registry** and **OpenAI Connector Registry**  
- Provide **verified MCP servers** for:
  - GitHub
  - Figma and design tools
  - Azure / cloud
  - Other SaaS and APIs  
- CodeLantern’s role:
  - Curate
  - Validate
  - Certify MCPs as **production-ready**
:::

---

## Archetypes

::: {.incremental}
- Blueprints for **how agents should build software**  
- Language & framework specific:
  - .NET, TypeScript, React, CSS
  - MudBlazor, Databricks, YAML
  - Terraform, Azure CLI, app archetypes  
- Curated by **expert consultants** assisted by `[curator]` agents  
- Enforce:
  - Coding standards
  - Design patterns
  - Architectural principles
:::

---

## Workflows

::: {.incremental}
- Defined, configured, and approved by the team  
- Executed by agents, monitored by humans  
- Examples:
  - `[ux-design]`, `[code-design]`, `[issue-design]`
  - `[implement]`, `[deploy]`  
- Each workflow binds:
  - A goal
  - The agents
  - The humans
  - The artifacts created
:::

---

## Boards & Analytics

::: {.incremental}
- A2D workflows surface as board items and analytics in GitHub  
- Track:
  - Throughput
  - Lead time
  - Agent performance  
- Provide the telemetry needed to continuously refine the system
:::

---

## Component Definitions

| Component                | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Work Item Templates**  | Issues, sub-issues, and PRs are structured consistently so agents can read/write them reliably. |
| **Agent Definitions**    | Describe agent roles and purpose, define allowed tools & workflows, and reinforce use of archetypes and patterns. |
| **Archetypes**           | Detailed guidance on frameworks and patterns agents must follow. Curated by experts with AI assistance. |
| **Workflows**            | Define what needs to be done, which agents & humans are involved, and the expected outputs. |

---

## Hiding the IP

![](../src/images/a2d-mikes-08.png){fig-alt="Abstract cube illustration representing hidden IP" width="70%"}

::: {.incremental}
- Agents depend on **definitions, archetypes, and workflows** stored as Markdown  
- Markdown is:
  - Easy to read
  - Easy to copy
  - Hard to protect as proprietary IP  
- We need to:
  - Conceal and version these artifacts
  - Keep client copies in sync with a **central source**
  - Offer controlled access to **paying customers**
:::

---

## Conceptual Proposed Solution*

::: {.incremental}
- Safeguard IP behind a **dedicated CodeLantern MCP server**  
- Publish that MCP server through the **GitHub registry**  
- Issue access tokens to **subscribers**  
- Support multiple versions:
  - Backwards compatibility
  - Ability to evolve with MCP ecosystem changes  
:::

\* This is a conceptual design; implementation details still to be validated.

---

## Proposed Architecture

![](../src/images/a2d-mikes-09.png){fig-alt="A2D proposed architecture diagram" width="90%"}

::: {.incremental}
- Work item (GitHub issue) is assigned to an agent  
- Agent opens a PR and starts a working session  
- Client org keeps **agent definitions** under `/.github/agents`  
- MCP servers involved:
  - GitHub MCP Registry
  - OpenAI Connector Registry
  - Figma / UX MCP
  - Azure MCP
  - **CodeLantern MCP** (hides archetype & workflow IP)  
- Agents execute workflows and submit work for **human review**
:::

---

## Workflows – Visual

![](../src/images/a2d-mikes-10.png){fig-alt="Colorful binders representing workflows" width="60%"}

::: {.incremental}
- Think of each workflow as a **binder**:
  - Clear entry criteria
  - Defined steps
  - Expected outputs
- A2D is a **set of binders** that teams can adopt and compose
:::

---

## Planning Workflow

![](../src/images/a2d-mikes-11.png){fig-alt="Planning meeting imagery with sticky notes" width="60%"}

::: {.incremental}
- Uses the **[planning-agent]**  
- Responsibilities:
  - Enhance descriptions & acceptance criteria
  - Split large items into sub-items and tasks
  - Ask clarifying questions where needed  
- Can recommend **next workflows** by analyzing:
  - Repo structure
  - Existing issues
  - Nature of the work  
- Outcome: a **high-quality, agent-ready backlog**
:::

---

## Suggestion Workflow

![](../src/images/a2d-mikes-12.png){fig-alt="Suggestion workflow imagery" width="60%"}

::: {.incremental}
- Scans:
  - Current issues
  - TODOs
  - Markdown checklists
  - Test coverage gaps  
- Produces:
  - A simple work item summarizing **what to work on next**  
- Used by:
  - Product owners
  - Architects  
- Often powered by the same **[planning-agent]** under the hood
:::

---

## User Interface Design Workflow (Future)

![](../src/images/a2d-mikes-13.png){fig-alt="Person holding phone in front of whiteboard with UI sketches" width="55%"}

::: {.incremental}
- Describe the UI that needs to be built  
- Generate UI options using project archetypes:
  - Material Design
  - MudBlazor
  - Tailwind, etc.  
- Present options and refine with stakeholders  
- Attach the chosen design to a new **implementation work item**
:::

---

## Solution Design & Analysis Workflow

![](../src/images/a2d-mikes-14.png){fig-alt="Magnifying glass over chart" width="70%"}

::: {.incremental}

  - Do it now vs. defer
:::

---

## Implement Workflow

![](../src/images/a2d-mikes-15.png){fig-alt="Colorful abstract background with callouts" width="70%"}

::: {.incremental}
- This is the **workhorse** of the system  
- A **[coder] agent** is instructed to:
  - Be concise and efficient with changes  
  - Minimize refactoring unless requested  
  - Respect existing patterns and decisions  
  - Write appropriate unit tests  
  - Produce well-documented PRs with screenshots where helpful
:::

---

## Deployment Workflow

![](../src/images/a2d-mikes-16.png){fig-alt="Cloud and infrastructure themed illustration" width="70%"}

::: {.incremental}
- Uses a **[deployment] agent** with skills in:
  - Terraform
  - Azure CLI
  - YAML
  - GitHub Actions  
- Responsibilities:
  - Inspect solution for deployment readiness  
  - Create Terraform and supporting scripts  
  - Ensure environment consistency  
  - Keep secrets safe and managed  
  - Enable repeatable deployments
:::

## Workflow Status (MVP View)

| Workflow                | Status              | Notes |
|-------------------------|--------------------|-------|
| **Planning**            | In Progress (~75%) | Enhances work items; needs tighter verbosity and better respect for PR-approval gates. |
| **Solution Design**     | In Progress (~80%) | Compares paths and recommends one; excellent docs but a bit verbose. |
| **Suggestion**          | In Progress (~60%) | Prototype that recommends next work; needs refinement. |
| **User Interface Design** | Planning (~25%)  | Will integrate with Figma/UX MCPs. |
| **Implementation**      | In Progress (~90%) | Most mature; produces concise, tested code with strong PRs. |
| **Deployment**          | Planning (~25%)    | Good scripts, needs stronger understanding of workflows and approvals. |

---

## Methodology Definition

::: {.incremental}
- As important as the technology itself  
- A2D will define **ceremonies** similar to Agile, but with shorter cycles  
- Likely better aligned with **Kanban** than strict sprints  
- Daily flow typically:
  1. **Plan** – morning planning with agents  
  2. **Design** – refine approaches  
  3. **Implement** – coding agents execute  
  4. **Review** – humans review & approve  
  5. **Deploy** – promote safely  
  6. **Verify** – validate outcomes  
- Then repeat
:::

---

## The Human Role

![](../src/images/a2d-mikes-19.png){fig-alt="Wooden figures representing people" width="60%"}

::: {.incremental}
- Humans remain central:
  - Provide context
  - Set direction & priorities
  - Give positive and negative feedback  
  - Review and approve all changes  
- A2D is about **augmenting**, not replacing, the team
:::

---

## Risks

![](../src/images/a2d-mikes-20.png){fig-alt="Risk and warning themed illustration" width="60%"}

::: {.incremental}
- GitHub Copilot and MCP ecosystem are **moving fast**  
- Many features are still in **preview**  
- Registries and servers are unstable; things break frequently  
- GitHub keeps tight control over agents and currently:
  - Limits coding agents largely to **Anthropic Sonnet**  
- Licensing:
  - $15–$30 USD per user per month today  
  - Unlikely to stay that low long-term  
- Agent drift:
  - Same inputs can produce slightly different outputs  
  - Governance and guardrails are essential
:::

---

## Phased Approach

![](../src/images/a2d-mikes-21.png){fig-alt="Roadmap illustration" width="70%"}

::: {.incremental}
- Start as a **services company** while artifacts mature  
- Package mature artifacts as a **subscription offering** later  
- Allow time for:
  - MCP landscape to stabilize  
  - Archetypes & workflows to be battle-tested  
- Generate revenue while:
  - Building & testing artifacts  
  - Proving the CodeLantern MCP concept
:::

---

## Use of Funds

![](../src/images/a2d-mikes-22.png){fig-alt="Five step funding plan diagram" width="90%"}

::: {.incremental}
1. Secure key resources (Jeff, PVZ, Nick)  
2. Focus full-time on A2D (modest salary)  
3. Build artifacts & workflows, plus custom MCP to hide IP  
4. Create demos & training to attract delivery consultants  
5. Cover software, operations, and marketing (licenses, conferences, brand, sales collateral)
:::

---

## Next Steps

![](../src/images/a2d-mikes-23.png){fig-alt="Checklist illustration" width="70%"}

::: {.incremental}
- Work on **funding** and structure  
- Secure **Jeff, Nick, Peter** with the right mix of base + upside  
- Publish a working **MVP demo**:
  - Planning agent
  - Architect agent
  - Coding agent
  - Deployment agent  
- Document & diagram workflows to:
  - Attract delivery consultants
  - Land first customers  
- Build a **Designer workflow** demo for extra “wow”  
- Implement the **custom MCP** to hide IP
:::

---

## Team & Compensation (Summary)

![](../src/images/a2d-mikes-24.png){fig-alt="Team and budget illustration" width="80%"}

::: {.incremental}
- **Nick Van Exan** – Senior engineer; target ~15K/month, pro-rated; equity/bonus to close gap  
- **Jeff Zado** – Sales/strategy; could start at ~5K/month + commission + upside  
- **Peter Vander Zouwe** – Sales/strategy; needs ~8K/month base + commission; open to equity  
- Use **commission-to-equity conversion** to:
  - Align incentives
  - Minimize burn
  - Reward early builders
