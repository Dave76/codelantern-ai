## Welcome {.title-slide}

**A2D Framework**

*AI-Augmented Development for Modern Teams*

::: {.notes}
Welcome to the A2D Framework presentation. This is an example of how to structure presentations using Quarto and Reveal.js.

## 🧠 What Is A2D?

**A**I-**A**ugmented **D**evelopment

A methodology that extends Agile for human-AI collaboration across the SDLC

::: {.incremental}
- **Not replacement**: AI augments, doesn't replace developers
- **Structured collaboration**: Defined roles and workflows
- **Quality-focused**: Built-in guardrails and review processes
- **Framework + Service**: Both methodology and execution
:::

::: {.notes}
A2D stands for AI-Augmented Development. It's important to emphasize this is about augmentation, not replacement.

## Core Concepts

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Archetypes
*The Playbooks*

- Reusable blueprints
- Technology-specific
- Best practices codified
- Examples: .NET Core API, React SPA
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Agents
*The Workforce*

- AI actors executing work
- Follow archetypes
- Specialized roles
- Examples: Planner, Architect, Coder
:::

## Agent Roles

| Agent | Responsibility | Code? |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| **Planning Agent** | Creates implementation plans, breaks down work | ❌ No |
| **Solution Architect** | Proposes designs, analyzes trade-offs | ❌ No |
| **CodeLantern Coder** | Implements code based on approved plans | ✅ Yes |

::: {.callout}
**Key Principle**: Planning and architecture agents explicitly do NOT write code
:::

## Planning Workflow

    A[User Request] --> B{Entry Point}
    B -->|Chat| C[Planning Agent Creates Plan]
    B -->|Existing Issue| D[Planning Agent Updates Plan]
    C --> E[Creates GitHub Issue]
    D --> E
    E --> F[Structured Plan with AC]
    F --> G[Ready for Implementation]

    classDef ai fill:#fff4e1,stroke:#ff6b35
    class A,G human
    class C,D,F ai
```

---

## Two Entry Points

::: {.incremental}
1. **From Chat**: User describes need, agent creates new issue with plan
2. **From Existing Issue**: User provides issue link, agent adds structured plan
:::

**Result**: Consistent planning format with acceptance criteria, scope, and risks

---

## MCP Architecture

**Model Context Protocol** enables agent-to-tool communication

```yaml
# Example: Agent tool configuration
tools:
  - "read"
  - "search"
  - "edit"
  - "github-mcp-server/issue_write"
```

Hierarchy: **Server** → **Toolset** → **Tool** → **Method**

---

## Benefits

::: {.incremental}
- ⚡ **Speed**: Faster development cycles
- 📋 **Structure**: Consistent planning and documentation
- 🎯 **Quality**: Built-in guardrails and review processes
- 📚 **Knowledge**: Archetypes capture institutional knowledge
- 🔄 **Flexibility**: Adapts to existing workflows
:::

---

## Getting Started

1. **Understand the framework** – Review documentation
2. **Define archetypes** – Create technology-specific blueprints
3. **Configure agents** – Set up tools and permissions
4. **Start small** – Pilot with one team/project
5. **Iterate** – Refine based on feedback

---

## Questions?

**Contact**: CodeLantern.AI

**Documentation**: See `/a2d/` and `/agents/` directories

**Next Steps**: Review detailed agent definitions and workflow docs

::: {.notes}
Open floor for questions. Key documents to reference: a2d-framework-overview.md, planning-workflow.md, agent definitions.
