Styles

- In razor components, prefer using [Inject] in the code section vs @inject at the top
- In razor components and classes in general fields should use _fieldname and fields should never be public
- Do not define styles inside components and no styled components. Move to common.css for better debugging/write/test cycle
<style>
    .measurement-display {
        font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums;
        white-space: nowrap;
    }
</style>


MeasurementDisplay should likely not display decimal points for mm if the user preference for mm is set to >= 1.0

For the Endgrain Rows configuration, we need to add the concept of row before, row after, or just rows inbetween.


There is a nicety of working through a PR with a local agent using VS Code.
- One a PR is ready for review I like pulling it into VS Code
- I can then have a conversation (chat) with the agent locally to make any changes
- Changes are concise and committed one at a time
Once complete, you can go back to the PR and have the GitHub agent update the PR description to capture an important changes
- this is actually much quicker for iterations


New Workflow (single ticket using neo agent, who can plan, design, code, test)
- Efficient. Accomplish same work, but use a single ticket and PR, minimize co-pilot sessions.
- Create work-item with a clear description and label "planning"
- Assign to agent, kickoff PR
- Agent should see the planning label and understand that a plan has not been created and should create a concise, but detailed draft in the PR. The PR must have a call to action at the end. "Should I go ahead and update the Issue?"
- The agent should then wait for a user to review and respond (explicit approval)
- GitHub issue should now be updated, with potential sub-issues linked to the parent issue
- Agent should then again ask for approval: Is the Issue to your liking? Should I start work?
- Yes, please start implementation.
- Review, as regular pull request.



Ok, so one thing about adding these STOP instructions, which are required for human approval in the process, it will definitely increase the number of premium sessions and thus increase cost.
Draft Plan (Min one session, plus any feedback cycles)
Create Update Issues (Min one session, plus any feedback cycles)
Complete Work (Min one session, plus any feedback cycles)
