**AI‑Augmented Development (A2D): Beyond Agile**

---

## Overview

**CodeLantern.AI** is the origin and steward of the **A2D Framework** — a practical methodology for teams to collaborate with intelligent agents across the SDLC. Where Agile optimized human collaboration, **A2D** optimizes human‑AI collaboration.

With a properly configured set of agents, teams can:
- Plan work in the morning
- Have agents implement and test during the day
- Review and deploy to test by afternoon

What once took a sprint can fit in a day.

## What Is A2D?

A2D is both a methodology and a service model for integrating AI agents into daily delivery:
- Methodology: principles, archetypes, and patterns for human‑AI teamwork.
- Service Model: enablement, coaching, and continuous evolution.

For principles and core assets, see `a2d/a2d-framework-overview.md`.

## Phases

### Phase 1 — A2D Framework Enablement
Establish foundations for AI‑augmented delivery within your environment.
- Kickstart Engagement (10 days)
- Sustain & Evolve Subscription (ongoing)
- Embedded Coach Program (named coach in‑workflow)

Outcomes include archetypes, agent definitions, governance, and measurable ROI. See pricing: `business-model/a2d-pricing.md`.

### Phase 2 - Applied AI Problem Solving
CodeLantern consultants use our own A2D practice to rapidly deliver outcomes for clients that may not have an A2D-capable team yet:
- Rapid development of production features, services, and integrations
- Outcome-first delivery using A2D archetypes, tests, and governance
- Agentic components where valuable, but not required
- Ideal for teams needing results now while their A2D capability grows

## The A2D Advantage
1. Enablement — Teams skilled at daily AI collaboration
2. Augmentation — Human creativity + machine efficiency
3. Application — Measurable business outcomes, not just output

A2D blends speed with security, compliance, and maintainability.
