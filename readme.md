# CodeLantern.AI  

**Illuminating the Future of Software Development**  

---

## 🌟 Overview

**CodeLantern.AI** represents the next evolution in software engineering methodology — the era of **AI-Augmented Development (A2D)**.  

From **Waterfall → Agile → AI-Augmented Development**, we are witnessing a paradigm shift.  
Where Agile optimized *human collaboration*, **A2D** optimizes *human–AI collaboration*.  

With a properly configured set of agents, teams can:  

- Plan work in the morning  
- Have AI agents implement and test throughout the day  
- Review and deploy to test environments by afternoon  

What once took a full sprint can now be accomplished in a single day.

## 🚀 Our Mission

To enable development teams to **embrace AI as a first-class participant** in their software delivery lifecycle.  
We help clients streamline and optimize every phase — from ideation to coding, reviewing, deploying, and operating — using intelligent agents, copilots, and modern engineering frameworks.  

---

## 🧭 Phase 1 — *AI-Augmented Development (A2D Framework)*

**Objective:** Establish the foundation for AI-Augmented Development — a methodology and operational model that embeds AI deeply into the daily developer workflow.  

**Key Components**

- **Kickstart Engagement** — a 10-day fixed-price onboarding to establish A2D foundations  
- **Sustain & Evolve Subscription** — continuous enablement, workflow optimization, and on-demand support  
- **Embedded Coach Program** — named AI coach integrated into client workflows  

**Outcomes**

- A2D-ready workflows integrating GitHub Copilot & Microsoft Agent Framework  
- Defined agent archetypes (developer, reviewer, product owner, QA)  
- Governance, security, and adoption playbooks  
- Productivity metrics and ROI dashboards  

📄 See [`ai-augment-dev-pricing.md`](./docs/pricing/ai-augment-dev-pricing.md) for detailed pricing and engagement structure.

## 💡 Phase 2 — *Applied AI Problem Solving*

Once a client’s A2D foundation is in place, CodeLantern.AI consultants apply the framework to **solve real business problems** — leveraging our own methodology to deliver end-to-end AI solutions.  

**Examples**

- Develop domain-specific copilots and autonomous agents  
- Automate business processes and product workflows  
- Integrate Microsoft AI Foundry and Agent Framework solutions  
- Deliver intelligent applications faster, cheaper, and smarter

## 🧩 The A2D Advantage

1. **Enablement** — Equip teams to use AI effectively in daily development  
2. **Augmentation** — Blend human creativity with machine efficiency  
3. **Application** — Use A2D principles to deliver real business outcomes  

A2D isn’t just a process — it’s a cultural and operational transformation in how software gets built.
